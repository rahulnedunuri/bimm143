Here we analyze a candy dataset from the 538 website. This is a csv file from their GitHub repository.


## Importing candy data

```{r}
#install.packages("skimr")
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)

```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?  

```{r}
length(unique(rownames(candy)))
```
There are 85 different candy types in this dataset.

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?   

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```
There are 38 fruity candy types in the dataset.


## What is your favorate candy?
> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is its winpercent value?  

```{r}
candy["Haribo Gold Bears", ]$winpercent
```
My favorite candy is Haribo Gold Bears and its win percent value is 57.12%.

 
> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?  
 
```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```
 Kit Kat's win percent is 76.77%.
 
> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?   

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```
Tootsie Roll's win percent is 49.65%.

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```
Winpercent appears to be on a different scale compared to the rest of the columns. Winpercent is in the format __._% while the rest of the columns are proportions aka 0._



> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

The 1 likely means that that row (type) of candy contains chocolate.
The 0 likely means that the type of candy doesn't contain chocolate. 



```{r}
inds_sorted <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds_sorted, ])
```
Candy with lowest winpercent is Nik L Nip with 22.45%.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + aes(winpercent) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 5)
```


> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?  

The distrubtion looks to be asymmetrical and skewed to the lower win percent values. This could be due to outliers with very low winpercent values. 


> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?  

The center is below 50%.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
choc <- candy[candy$chocolate == 1, ]
fruity <- candy[candy$fruity == 1, ]

choc_mean_win <- mean(choc$winpercent)
fruity_mean_win <- mean(fruity$winpercent)
paste("chocolate avg win ranking", choc_mean_win)
paste("fruity avg win ranking", fruity_mean_win)
```
On average, chocolate candy is higher ranked than fruity candy.


> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(choc$winpercent, fruity$winpercent)
```
From a two sample t-test, the p-value is smaller than 0.05 so the difference between chocolate and fruity candy winpercent ratings is statistically different at the 95% confidence level. 




## Overall Candy Ratings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),])
```
The 5 least liked candy types are Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, and Jawbusters


> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent, decreasing=T),])
```
The top 5 candies are Reese's Peanut Butter cups, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, and Snickers

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.


```{r}
#Start with all black with the same number of rows as the candy df.
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))

my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "brown"
#my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "navy"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col(width=1,fill=my_cols) +
  theme(axis.text.y=element_text(size=3)) +
  labs(y= "Candy Type", x = "Win percentage")
```
> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(width=1,fill=my_cols) +
  #theme(axis.text.y=element_text(size=3)) +
  labs(y= NULL, x = "Win percent")

ggsave('candy_barplot.png', width=7, height=10)
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Based on the graph, Sixlets is the worst ranked chocolate candy. 

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Based on the graph, Starburst is the best ranked fruity candy.


## Taking a look at pricepercent

```{r}
candy$pricepercent
```

If we want to see good candies to buy in terms of high winpercent and lowest pricepercent, we can plot these two variables and then see the best candy for the least amount of money. 


```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x=winpercent, y=pricepercent, label=(rownames(candy))) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text()

```

To avoid the labels from colliding and overlapping (overplotting), we can use an add-on package called `ggrepel`

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x=winpercent, y=pricepercent, label=(rownames(candy))) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel()
```

Let's adjust the `max.overlaps` argument for `geom_text_repel()`
```{r}
# Too hard to see pink labels
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "red"


ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x=winpercent, y=pricepercent, label=(rownames(candy))) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 10, col=my_cols)
```



> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's miniatures have a very high winpercent and low price percent.



> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing=T),])
```

The most expensive types are Nik L Nip, Ring pop, Nestle Smarties, Hershey's Krackel, Hershey's Milk Chocolate.

The least popular of these is Nik L Nip.



## Exploring the correlation structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Anti correlated variables include:
Fruity and chocolate
fruity and bar
chocolate and hard
bar and pluribus
fruity and pricepercent
fruity and winpercent


> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Most positively correlated are chocolate and winpercent


## Principal Component Analysis


```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=T)
summary(pca)
```

Plot my main PCA score plot with ggplot.

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```


```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])

p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols) +
        labs(title="PCA Space Map") +
        geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)

p
```

```{r}
#library(ggrepel)

p  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

Loadings plot


```{r}

loadings <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)
ggplot(loadings) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(loadings), PC1)) +
  geom_col()
```


> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Positive direction includes fruity, pluribus, and hard candy. This makes sense since these were positively correlated with one another in the correlation matrix earlier!
